# bloogsugarml
My colabs and analysis of my blood sugar levels over time, learning how to apply ML/AI methods

The main goal is to re-acquaint myself with modern libraries for regression, neural networks and (ultimately) LLMs.

I am studying the [Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course). 
My general approach is to do the lessons and then re-apply to my blood sugar levels to see if I can improve prediction.
